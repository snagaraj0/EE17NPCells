# EE17NPCells

Parametric cell macros (Pcells) for Klayout. Used in the Stanford EE17N class. PCells are useful when you want the same general structure but with a few small changes to sizes.

To use, copy EE17N.lym into <klayout_folder>/pymacros and the .py files into <klayout_folder>/python. To add new macros, create the file with implementation details and add its declaration to EE17N.lym.
